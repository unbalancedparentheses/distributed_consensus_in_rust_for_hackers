## fallacies of distributed computing
- original ones from deutsch,
  - emphasis in unreliable networks
  - there's some concrete examples and data in data-intensive book, eg. about failures in cloud environments
  - see also https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2655736

## other problems
- pitfall: a remote call is just like a funcion call.
  - see "A Note on Distributed Computing", Waldo
- unreliable clocks
- nodes die / expect failures
- (maybe) end to end system design
